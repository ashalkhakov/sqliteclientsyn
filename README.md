SQLiteClientSyncProvider
------------------------

This is a synchronization provider for use with Microsoft ADO.NET Sync
Services 1.0 for Devices. It is based on a project of the same name by
[Jose Romaniello](https://sourceforge.net/p/sqliteclientsyn/).

For usage example, please see
[SyncComm](https://synccomm.codeplex.com/). You will have to convert
SQL Server CE code to use SQLite, but it is a pretty straightforward
thing to do.
